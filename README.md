# playground

I've created this repo to play around with code.  Going through my coding bootcamp I've often found the desire to test certain theories I have about coding but due to the time constraints of the school I've had little time.  This repo will be an area for me to conduct my test and appease my curiosity.  I will detail the tests conducted in each branch.
